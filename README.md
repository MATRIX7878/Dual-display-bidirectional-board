Few to no boards offer bidirectional audio and video ports.  I have decided to change that.  This PCB is designed with bidirectional HDMI and DisplayPort ports for switching whenever needed.  It uses a SYZYGY connector to communicate with an FPGA, or SoC.  This board could be used for computer vision as it could intake HDMI, or DisplayPort and then do something like edge detection and then output the resultant video on the other line.  This is a board that is designed from TI reference boards for dev kits that are not for sale.
